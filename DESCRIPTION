Description: This R package helps the user identify k-mers 
    (e.g. di- or tri-nucleotides) present periodically in a set of genomic 
    loci (typically regulatory elements). The functions of this package 
    provide a straightforward approach to find periodic occurrences 
    of k-mers in DNA sequences, such as regulatory 
    elements. It is not aimed at identifying motifs separated by a 
    conserved distance; for this type of analysis, please visit MEME website.
